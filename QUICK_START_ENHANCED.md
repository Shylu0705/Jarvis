```

## üîß Configuration

### Webcam Settings
Edit `config.yaml`:
```yaml
webcam:
  camera_index: 0       # Try 1, 2 if webcam doesn't work
  resolution: [640, 480]
  fps: 30
  enable_face_detection: true
  enable_object_detection: true
```

### Voice Profiles
```yaml
enhanced_tts:
  default_profile: "jarvis"
  voice_profiles:
    jarvis:
      rate: 160
      volume: 0.9
    friendly:
      rate: 180
      volume: 0.8
    news:
      rate: 140
      volume: 0.95
    whisper:
      rate: 120
      volume: 0.6
```

### Memory Settings
```yaml
memory:
  db_path: "./jarvis_memory"
  max_memories: 10000
  auto_cleanup_days: 30
```

## üé® Voice Profiles

- **Jarvis**: Professional, clear (default)
- **Friendly**: Warm, conversational
- **News**: Formal, authoritative
- **Whisper**: Quiet, intimate

## üß† Memory Features

- **Conversation History**: Remembers all chats
- **Semantic Search**: Find past conversations by meaning
- **User Preferences**: Learns your settings
- **Action Logging**: Tracks what Jarvis has done
- **Context Awareness**: Uses past conversations for better responses

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Webcam Issues
```powershell
# Check available cameras
python -c "import cv2; print([i for i in range(10) if cv2.VideoCapture(i).isOpened()])"

# Try different camera index in config.yaml
camera_index: 1  # or 2, 3, etc.
```

### Memory Database Issues
```powershell
# Reset memory database
rm -rf ./jarvis_memory
# Restart Jarvis to recreate database
```

### Voice Issues
```powershell
# Check available system voices
python -c "import pyttsx3; engine = pyttsx3.init(); print([v.name for v in engine.getProperty('voices')])"
```

### Performance Issues
```yaml
# Reduce memory usage
memory:
  max_memories: 1000  # Instead of 10000

# Lower webcam resolution
webcam:
  resolution: [320, 240]
  fps: 15
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Memory Stats
```
memory stats
```

### View Logs
```powershell
# Check log file
Get-Content jarvis.log -Tail 20
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Memory usage: Check `jarvis_memory` folder size
- CPU usage: Monitor during webcam operations
- Response time: Should be < 2 seconds for simple queries

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Try all voice profiles**: Test different personalities
2. **Experiment with webcam**: Try face detection and scene analysis
3. **Build memory**: Have conversations to populate the database
4. **Customize settings**: Adjust voice, memory, and webcam parameters
5. **Explore advanced features**: Use semantic search and context awareness

## üÜò Getting Help

- Check the logs: `jarvis.log`
- Memory issues: `memory stats` command
- Webcam problems: Try different `camera_index`
- Voice issues: Check system voice availability
- Performance: Reduce resolution/memory limits

## üöÄ Advanced Features Coming Soon

- Object detection with YOLO
- Gesture recognition
- Emotion detection
- GUI interface
- API integrations
- Mobile companion app

Enjoy your enhanced Jarvis! ü§ñ‚ú®
